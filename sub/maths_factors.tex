As said above, there are factors to consider when determining which battery storage system is the "best". Here we have included several important factors that our model use:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Power rating
\end{enumerate}
In an AC circuit, the power rating determines the ability to discharge and supply enough power to electrical appliances. Therefore, by having a high power-rating, a battery can supply more electricity to more devices, making it an important factor when evaluating a battery system.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Capacity of the battery storage system
\end{enumerate}
If the array's capacity is too low, the system will either struggle to power the entire home or have the depth-of-discharge higher than the recommended level. In that case, without another backup power grid, the system will shut down, leaving electric appliances in the house unusable, and the lifetime of the batteries will decrease.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Length of autonomy
\end{enumerate}
In the worst-case scenario, there will be days without sufficient energy to charge the batteries up to full capacity. The system must not shut down during usage. Since weather patterns vary throughout the country, each customer will have specific demand of length of autonomy.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Efficiency of the battery storage system
\end{enumerate}
It is unavoidable that some electricity transmitted through the circuit is wasted. Therefore, to retain as much charge as possible, the system's efficiency should be as high as can be achieved.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Lifetime of a battery
\end{enumerate}
The lifetime of a battery describes both the number of years it can effectively charge and the number of cycles it can run when using at a certain depth of discharge. Since the lifetime of the battery is tied to the cost (the higher the lifetime, the average cost will be lower), it is considered to be an important factor in our model.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Warranty of a battery
\end{enumerate}
The warranty of a battery describes the number of years a battery can last before losing too much capacity to charge and deliver electricity effectively. As this factor is tied to the lifetime of a battery, we have decided to include it in our mathematical model.

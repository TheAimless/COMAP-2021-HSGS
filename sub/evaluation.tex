The proportions contributing to the general rating can be changed easily, and we decided to make some adjustments to select the most accurate model. In addition, since the priorities of each person when installing a battery storage system are different, this ratio will adapt to different circumstances. In the end, we decided to alter several factors by increasing the cost rating to around 30\%-35\% and decreasing the capacity an equivalent amount, changing the lifetime rating and changing several formulas, et cetera. This results in what we believe to be the "best" model; however, the term "best" is relativistic, and other people may hold different views on what the "best" model is. We acknowledge that and respect their decisions, though our team has faith in the model's accuracy.

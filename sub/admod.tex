\begin{enumerate}
    \item Ease of use
\end{enumerate}
Our team designed a simple model catering to the general public, as other complex models will require a prior understanding of the inner workings of electrical circuits, which might prevent many people from learning this model.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Flexibility
\end{enumerate}
Since our model depends on multiple factors, changing one or multiple variables can alter the model, giving different results. This can be incredibly useful when the conditions of the problem change as we have tested our model using different values. Therefore, the result will not be fixed, allowing users to have accurate and objective views on which battery type to choose.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Applicable to other types of batteries
\end{enumerate}
Each battery will produce different parameters; however, the conversion of each parameter into a more general one (i.e., same capacity rating, cost rating) will make comparisons more feasible than making comparisons of two entirely different batteries.

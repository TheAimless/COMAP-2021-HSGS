\begin{enumerate}
    \item The weight and dimension of the battery are not taken into account in the model
\end{enumerate}
As the model only considers  electrical specifications of the batteries, physical aspects (e.g. weight, dimension) will not be represented in the model. This is because each battery storage system's location is dependent on the house layout, and different house plans make it difficult to model the weight and dimension consistently.

    \item The battery array might be heterogeneous (i.e. having multiple types of batteries in the same system)
\end{enumerate}
In order to optimise both the cost and efficiency of the system, our team will test several layouts that make use of multiple types of batteries (i.e. lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, LFP batteries). The main reason for this is to evaluate the model more fairly, which helps us develop a stronger solution.

    \item A day consists of a cycle
\end{enumerate}
Since electricity is consumed continuously in the evening and batteries are charged continuously in daytime, it is reasonable to assume that a day consists a charge/discharge cycle.

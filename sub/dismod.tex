\begin{enumerate}
    \item Large margin of error
\end{enumerate}
A problem in the model is that the margin of error may be potentially larger than expected, or the calculating process may not be as accurate. Since the model ignores several small factors, a margin of error is inevitable.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The model is relativistic
\end{enumerate}
Our model is for reference only, allowing users to assess different batteries using a rating scale but does not allow unabridged assessments among different types of batteries. Batteries with higher ratings might be better, but they might not necessarily suit one's budget or demands. However, we have developed recommended criteria for choosing the most suitable battery for one's home so that readers can decide.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Several factors left out
\end{enumerate}
During our calculation process, several complex or unimportant factors have been left out. However, in certain cases, these factors might play more important roles. It would be difficult to assess their importance; hence we decided to leave them out. To make the most reasonable choice, one can still refer to our model and consider variables not presented in our model.

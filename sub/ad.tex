When assessing the benefits that cement batteries may potentially bring to home users, we discover that cement batteries have multiple advantages over either lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Installation location
\end{enumerate}
In addition, some criteria need to be addressed concerning the storage cells where the batteries will be installed for traditional lead-acid batteries or lithium-ion batteries. For example, many lead-acid batteries require more space and need to be stored in a well-ventilated area; lithium-ion batteries need to be installed in a cool and heat-conductive location to mitigate the risk of overheating. On the other hand, cement-based batteries, which are installable inside walls, do not take up additional space. This may contribute to the next advantage:

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Cement batteries come pre-installed
\end{enumerate}
When installing a solar battery storage system, homeowners have to consider multiple factors, including energy demands, costs, lifetime, et cetera. Nevertheless, when installing cement batteries within the house, the architect and electrician have to plan the integration of such a system. As a result, when the homeowner decides to reside in the house, the system will be readily available, reducing the need for further adjustments.

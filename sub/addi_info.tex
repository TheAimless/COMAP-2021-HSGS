We believe there are additional requirements that are important to a photovoltaic system but have not been addressed yet in the research above. By obtaining more data on these values, we can determine the feasibility of integrating cement batteries in solar-powered households:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Battery lifetime
\end{enumerate}
As cement batteries are possibly difficult to maintain and replace, the lifetime of cement batteries is one of the most important factors, as fewer repairs are equivalent to less average cost over time. Therefore, more research on the lifespan of these batteries using different combinations of anode/cathode and multiple conditions is needed.
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Cost of installation
\end{enumerate}
Since users want to minimise the cost of installation when installing solar batteries, if the correlation between house size, energy demand per day and cost of installation and maintenance can be determined, we will be able to assess the benefits of cement batteries with more clarity.

\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Power ratings 
\end{enumerate}
Our mathematical model presented above calculates the rating of each battery listed through the formula\eqref{eq:-2}. Therefore, to effectively evaluate the cement battery through our model, the continuous and instantaneous power rating of the battery - which takes up to 30\% in our mathematical model -  should be addressed.

As such, although our research has addressed the energy density of the material, additional experiments on the battery are necessary for us to evaluate its effectiveness.

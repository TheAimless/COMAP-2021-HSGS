Concerning the drawbacks of such a system, many problems may arise during the installation, usage and maintenance process. Here are a few examples that our team has gathered:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Scalability
\end{enumerate}
In the study above, Emma Zhang and Luping Tang used coated-metal electrodes with a dimension of 100 mm $\times$ 100 mm $\times$ 4 mm, while the size of the metal-coated CF meshes was 90 mm $\times$ 90 mm $\times$ 1 mm. However, when installing cement batteries in walls, the CF meshes' sizes will have to be scaled up, causing problems in scalability that manufacturers have to overcome.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Difficulty to install in vertical walls
\end{enumerate}
The diagram below illustrates the method the researchers used to construct their model:

\label{fig:bat}
\end{figure}
The researchers had to embed the metal-coated CF mesh within the cement for the battery to function. When pouring cement into the cast, it had to be spread out into thin layers so that the results would be consistent. However, during the construction of a vertical wall, each concrete brick will be laid out alternatingly with steel beams before grout concrete is poured between the spaces to strengthen the wall.

\end{figure}
This will lead to difficulties during both the construction of walls and the installation of cement batteries, which have not been solved yet.

\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Maintenance issues
\end{enumerate}
If concrete walls are constructed using the above method, it will be impossible to investigate troubles that may arise during the maintenance process without harming the internal structures of the building. Consequently, parts of the wall will have to be destroyed and rebuilt to fix issues. In summary, the maintenance process will be costly and potentially be disruptive to both the electric grid and the family.

When assessing the benefits that cement batteries may potentially bring to the home users, there are many beneficial factors that cement batteries can have when compared to either lead-acid or lithium-ion batteries:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Installation location
\end{enumerate}
When dealing with traditional lead-acid batteries or lithium-ion batteries, these storage cells have additional criteria concerning with the installation of the batteries. For example, many lead-acid batteries are bulky and need to be stored in a well-ventilated are; lithium-ion batteries need to be installed in a cool area that is easy to transmit heat to mitigate the risk of overheating. On the other hand, cement-based batteries, which can be installed inside walls, do not take up additional space. This means that the above factor leads to the next advantage:
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Cement batteries are come pre-installed
\end{enumerate}
When installing a solar battery storage system, homeowners will have to consider multiple factors including energy demands, costs, lifetime, etc. Nevertheless, when installing cement batteries within the house, the architect and electrician have to plan the integration of such system within the house itself. As a result, when the homeowner decides to reside in the house, the system will be readily available, resulting in less plannings for the user.

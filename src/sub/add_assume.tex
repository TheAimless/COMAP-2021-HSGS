\begin{enumerate}
    \item The weight and dimension is not considered in the following model
\end{enumerate}
As the model only considers the electrical specifications of the batteries, physical aspects (e.g. weight, dimension) will not be represented in the model. This is because each battery storage system's location is dependent on the house layout, and different 1600 square-feet houses have different plannings, which makes it inconsistent to model the weight and dimension.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item The battery array may be heterogeneous (i.e. having multiple types of batteries in the same system)
\end{enumerate}
In order to optimise both the cost and efficiency of the system, our team will model several layouts that make use of multiple types of batteries (i.e. lithium-ion batteries, lead-acid batteries, LFP batteries). The main reason for this is to evaluate the model in many dimensions, which will result in a strengthened solution.

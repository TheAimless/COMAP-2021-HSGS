After looking at the advantages and disadvantages of cement batteries, we have brainstormed and established important details regarding the incorporation of cement batteries within a photovoltaic system. First, these batteries will only be installed on the floors and the ceilings. As vertical wall requires concrete bricks to be laid, before cement is filled in the gaps, it will require additional researches and experiments before vertical walls that also act as cement batteries can be developed for general usage. Therefore, in the following diagram, the battery can be implemented inside the concrete slab, between the insulation layer and damp-proof membrane:

By having two pieces of uncoated CF as current collectors as presented in Figure~\ref{fig:bat}, we can direct the current through an inverter, which will then supply energy to electric appliances within the house. In addition, the multiple floors and ceilings inside the home will allow more electricity to be stored, thus possibly powering the entire house on its own.

When installing a photovoltaic system for home usage, there are many variables and aspects to be taken into account. The factors taken into consideration are listed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Cost of installation
\end{enumerate}
There are many homeowners who will spend too much money on the system, wasting both money and energy during the process. In addition, many customers are on a budget, and it is necessary to minimise the installation cost of the battery storage system.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Capacity of the battery storage system
\end{enumerate}
If the capacity of the array is too low, the system will either not be sufficient to power the entire home or having the depth-of-discharge higher than the recommended level. In that case, without another back-up power grid, the system will shutdown, leaving electric appliances in the house unusable, or decrease the lifetime of the batteries.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Length of autonomy
\end{enumerate}
The weather pattern varies throughout the country. It is necessary for the system not to shut down during usage. Hence, each customer will have a specific demand of length of autonomy.
\begin{enumerate}[resume]
    \item Efficiency of the battery storage system
\end{enumerate}
It is unavoidable that some electricity transmitted through circuit will be wasted. Therefore, in order to retain as much charge as possible, the efficiency of the system should be as high as possible.

$$V=\left[\begin{array}{ll}2.085-0.12 & (1-S O C)\end{array}\right]-\frac{I}{C_{10}}\left(\frac{4}{1+I^{1.3}}+\frac{0.27}{S O C^{1.5}}+0.02\right)(1-0.007 \Delta T)$$

$$R M S E=\left[\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[\frac{C_{i}-M_{i}}{M_{i}}\right]^{2}\right]^{1 / 2} \times 100$$

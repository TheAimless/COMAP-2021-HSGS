\begin{enumerate}
    \item No research on immersed structure cement battery 
\end{enumerate}
Zhang et al. in this experiment only focus on the results of the layered structure cement battery. Therefore, it is impossible to compare the advantages and disadvantages between the two types of cement battery.
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item No research on bigger (i.e. ceiling) cement batteries 
\end{enumerate}
    The article above only deals with the metal-coated CF mesh of size 90 mm x 90 mm. Hence, the result of the experiment might not hold true for bigger sized batteries.
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Scalability of metal-coated CF meshes 
\end{enumerate}
    The area of the metal-coated CF mesh is 90 mm x 90 mm, and we can not be certain on the production of bigger meshes.
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item No data on the the continuous rating, instantaneous rating and lifetime 
\end{enumerate}
    The experiment does not deal with these issues.

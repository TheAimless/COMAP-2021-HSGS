Before the technology can become widespread among solar users, there are additional requirements that we believe are important to a photovoltaic system but has not been addressed yet in the research above. By having additional information on these values, we can determine the plausibility and possibility of integrating cement batteries inside solar-powered houses:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Battery lifetime
\end{enumerate}
As cement batteries are possibly very difficult to maintain and replace, the lifetime of cement batteries is one of the most important factors, as fewer repairs is equivalent to less average cost in the long run. Therefore, there should be a research on the lifespan of these batteries using different combinations of anode/cathode and under different conditions.
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Depth of Discharge
\end{enumerate}
Because the lifetime of cement batteries are crucial, there should be an additional model describe the relationship between the batteries' depth of discharge and the number of cycles (i.e. lifetime) it can run. By modelling these variables, researchers can provide essential information that homeowners might consult prior to the installation of these batteries.
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item Power ratings (i.e. Continuous and instantaneous power rating)
\end{enumerate}
Our mathematical model presented above calculates the rating of each battery listed through 
\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
    \item 
\end{enumerate}


As such,

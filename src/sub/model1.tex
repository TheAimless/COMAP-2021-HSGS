Lead acid battery is the most used storage element in PV system. The main function of lead acid batteries is the storage and the supply of energy in a PV system. The stored energy is chemical can be converted into electrical and vice versa. The electrochemical reactions are described by the following reactions.

In general, the battery behavior is described by its voltages.
$$
V=V_{o c} \pm I R
